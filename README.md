# react-components
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

# React
React is “a JavaScript library for building user interfaces,” that gives you tools for interacting with the DOM that are cleaner and more performant than with raw JavaScript or jQuery.

React is declarative, rather than imperative. Imperative code, like raw JavaScript or jQuery, says how something ought to occur. Declarative code (HTML being an example) states what something ought to be, and hides the how away from the developer. Therefore, in React, you write components that looks a lot like HTML, and the React library, hidden from you, handles the details of how these components are actually rendered to the DOM.

Think of React components as superpowered HTML tags that:

Can be given information for how they ought to behave
Can communicate with each other
Can be composed, reused and nested together to build small to very large applications
React is used on some of the largest websites in the world, including Instagram and Facebook, where React was developed. It is fast, does an excellent job supporting code modularity and reuse, and developers tend to find it clean and fun to work with.

During this exercise you will:

Learn how to create React components
Learn how to render React components
Learn how to use JSX and ES6 in React code
Learn how to utilize props
Learn how React components handle user events
Learn the difference between stateless functional components and class components
Learn why there is state and how to update it
